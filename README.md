# AdaBoost-Algorithm-in-R
Adaboost algorithm implemented from scratch using decision stump as the base classifier. The algorithm was tested on USPS data, the training, 5-fold cross validation, and testing error rates are plotted in error_rate.pdf. In the plot, B is the number of iterations of training.
